# ym2151-composer

Hello!  As you look through this, please keep in mind that it was one of, if not the, first code I wrote that wasn't a one-file shell or python script.

## What is this?

It was an attempt to write a music composition tool for the YM2151 in python.

In early 2019, a friend was writing a game engine for the [Commander X16](https://www.commanderx16.com/forum/index.php?/home/).  He was developing a small game alongside it as part of the engine development and asked me if I wanted to compose music and sound effects for it.  I said "yes", but there was one catch: at the time, the Commander X16 used only the [YM2151](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_YM2151) and I had never programmed for a microcontroller before.  Still, it seemed fun so I hopped in and began writing this code.  Development stopped in mid-late 2019 and no further updates are planned at this time unless my interest piques again.

## What does it do?

It has several utilities:
* `sequencer.py`contains the following classes:
    * *Step* (represents one subdivision of a measure)
    * *Pattern* (a virtually unlimited length sequence of steps)
    * *Sequence* (a virtually unlimited length sequence of patterns)
* `instrument.py` contains the following class:
    * *Instrument* (instrument definitions for the [YM2151](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_YM2151))
* `convert_mid.py` is used to convert midi files generated by midi-ox into commands for the YM2151
* `convert_dmp.py` is used to convert .dmp instruments to .spi
* `convert_opm.py` is used to convert .opm instruments to .spi

## How do I use it?

For now, you don't.  It's currently non-functional and doesn't work well anyway.  

How it *did* work at one time was:

1) Create a script such as the ones in `songs/`
2) Run said script to generate an spt file
3) Convert from spt to SP using `spconvert.py` from [x16-music-player](https://github.com/jjbliss/x16-music-player)
4) Use [x16-music-player](https://github.com/jjbliss/x16-music-player) to play the SP file in a Commander X16 emulator.

Essentially, you create some `Steps`, then some `Patterns` to hold them and then put the patterns in a `Sequencer` before finally calling `to_spt()` on your `Sequencer`.  Right now, it doesn't produce an output file, but that is what it was intended to do.

## Glossary

**sp**: file extension for binary files to be fed to YM2151
* Stands for "Star Path", an old music alias of mine
    * Yes, yes, it's not a useful name
* none of this code directly deals with .sp files, see [x16-music-player](https://github.com/jjbliss/x16-music-player) instead

**spt**: file extenstion for "SP Textfile"
* a series of commands and values sent to the YM2151 to represent both notes and controls
* Each line *must* have:
    * An integer representing the YM2151 command followed by a comma
    * An integer representing the value for the command
* Each line *can* have:
    * A comment, delimited by a semicolon after any commands or data

**spi**: file extenstion for "SP Instrument"
* `.spi` files are very similar to `.spt`
    * just a series of commands send to the YM2151 which configures the operators to produce a specific timbre.
* Each line *must* have:
    * An integer representing the YM2151 command followed by a comma
    * An integer representing the value for the command
* Each line *can* have:
    * A comment, delimited by a semicolon after any commands or data
